# 👨🏻‍💼 About Me:

My name is Adil Maharramov, im a passionate fullstack developer from Azerbaijan. I first started to code in 2022, when I was 13 years old. At that times I loved to make simple computer games in unity. Later I switched from making games to making websites. I love writing code and learning new things.
